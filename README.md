## Typescript Challanges
![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

I plan to do [typescript challanges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges), but I do not want to send an issue as they recommend because there are so many of the same ones there. I will create an issue only for ones that I might find a different solution from others, which is unlikely seeing the many issues posted already.
